I looked at the use of QSCAT (Quick SCAT satellite) data, and how it can be used to judge of amount of urbanization that has occurred in an area and its environmental impact. The specific study I looked at used decadal level L1B Ku-Band (at the frequency of 13.4 GHz and wavelength of 2.24 cm), recorded by the QSCAT, to generate radar backscatter data. Even though QSCAT data is taken consistently and often, it is low resolution. To account for this, a DSM (dense sampling method) is applied to the data, which takes the mean values of the backscatter intensity over time, about a year in this study, to generate a higher resolution map of the QSCAT data. In addition, DSM uses a 10% frequency threshold to include only lights that persist over time, meaning that events such as fire and gas flare-ups are not included in the data. The DSM data is then presented in a grid fashion, 30x30 in this case, with each individual component being the mean of the samples for that specific location in the region being studied. Ten yearsâ€™ worth of data was collected and compared to show the increase in urbanization. This DSM data can measure the urbanization of a region by measuring the intensity of the emitted light, since the light is a higher intensity when refracted off large structure, and metallic or glass structures as opposed to wood. Increases in vehicles also increase the amount of backscatter present in the region. High backscatter data may not only reflect urban areas, but natural areas such as forests or mountains as well. Using stable nightlight data for the region, and the same DSM method, the researchers were able to identify which parts of the backscatter data was urban, and which parts were natural. Also, rural vs urban areas could be determined by the variance in the backscatter of a cell in the backscatter model, since urban areas would have a high variance in light intensity over time, while rural areas would have a low variance in light intensity over time. NO2 density was retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) spectrometer on the European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2) and compared to the backscatter data to determine the relationship between the environmental impact of the urbanization. In the study I looked at the urbanization of Beijing was studied and using the DSM method combined with the QSCAT data, Beijing was shown to have quadrupled urbanization from 2000-2010. NO2 concentrations in the air also greatly increased, which suggests that the rapid urbanization of Beijing has a causal relationship to the increase in air pollution.
